# Java Projects Repository

This repository includes two of my Java projects: Multi-Mode Multi-Typed Calculator and the Combined Billing System. Each project is designed to demonstrate various functionalities and features using Java programming.

## Projects

### Multi-Mode Multi-Typed Calculator

The Multi-Mode Multi-Typed Calculator is a versatile Java application featuring four activity windows. It provides a main page for navigation and specialized calculators for:

- **Decimal Arithmetic:** Perform basic and advanced arithmetic operations with decimal numbers.
- **Number Systems:** Handle binary, octal, and hexadecimal number systems.
- **Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions:** Calculate values for various trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.
- **Logarithmic and Percentage Functions:** Perform logarithmic calculations and calculate percentages.

Users can perform a wide range of calculations with different input types and number systems.

### Combined Billing System

The Combined Billing System is a Java application that generates comprehensive bills for water, gas, electricity, internet, and phone services. By inputting customer details and usage data, the system calculates and saves the corresponding bill amounts in files, ensuring detailed and organized billing information for each customer. The system includes:

- **Customer Details:** Input customer information including ID, name, and usage data.
- **Bill Calculation:** Automatically calculate bills for water, gas, electricity, internet, and phone services.
